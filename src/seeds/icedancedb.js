Unfortunately, they have consistency issues and tend to hurt themselves during their performances (though ice dance is usually the only discipline where don't wipe out too often). I really wish them a great outing in Grenoble.",

In the movie, Pierre and Lorenza express their frustration with their career never quite taking off despite all their efforts. Julia and Pierre are a brand new pair and a host pick here, so we shouldn't expect miracles from them. I just hope they skate cleanly and get valuable international experience together.",

Charlène and Marco have been here forever (they competed at the Olympics twice, and were in the top 10 last time) but they're still a very, very strong team. I love Charlène, she has strong features and she's super expressive, and the level of performance she has with Marco can only be achieved through years and years of partnership. I hope they get a spot on the podium here, they definitely deserve it.",

They're also one of those teams who competed to Despacito at the last Olympics. Should be interesting.",

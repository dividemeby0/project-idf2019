          Figure skating is hard! Here are some more or less technical terms you
          might not be familiar with.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>BV</b>
          <br></br>All technical elements have a pre-defined base value. For
          instance, if you land a valid triple axel, whatever happens, you'll
          get a base value of 8.00 points. That base value is then added to the
          grade of execution of the element (GOE). In that case, if your triple
          axel was particularly impressive, you can get up to 13.00 points out
          of it. On the other hand, if you landed on your ass after a really
          ugly axel, you will only end up with 3.00 points. The GOE affects the
          number of points you get out of an element, but as long as the element
          is valid its BV will remain the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Edge</b>
          <br></br>On a skate, the edges of the blade are the parts on each side
          of the blade's flat bottom. Skating on the deep edges of the blade,
          with the bottom part barely touching the ice, is considered beautiful
          and a sign of good skating skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Element</b>
          <br></br>A technical element is an element that is graded in the
          judging system. Each element is worth a certain number of points. Some
          very impressive stuff can happen on the ice but not qualify as a
          technical element in the score system. The elements are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>- Jumps and jump combinations</li>
          <li>- Spins</li>
          <li>- Step Sequences</li>
          <li>- Lifts and twist lifts (pairs)</li>
          <li>- Throws (pairs)</li>
          <li>- Death spirals (pairs)</li>
          <li>- Patterns (ice dance)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Four Continents</b>
          <br></br>The Four Continents Figure Skating Championships is like the
          European Championships, but for every other continent. It's the
          highlight of the season for many Japanese, American and Chinese
          skaters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>GOE</b>
          <br></br>The Grade Of Execution is the score granted to a skater for
          the execution of an element. It can range from -5 to +5. For each
          element, the judges have a list of bullet points to assess the quality
          of the element, and they grant more or less points depending on the
          number of applicable bullets points. At the end of the program,
          elements base values and GOE are summed up and form the 'technical'
          part of the score. This is supposed to make the judging fair and
          consistent. However, judges rarely apply their own rules and GOE can
          be as subjective as PCS.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>PCS</b>
          <br></br>Program Components Scores are the scores that do not depend
          on the execution of the technical elements. It's the 'artistic' part
          of the score. Five criteria are evaluated: skating skills,
          transitions, performance, composition and interpretation. You can
          -presumably- have amazing jumps and low PCS, and be a very artistic
          skater with super high PCS and a fairly low technical score. PCS are
          more subjective and can be quite abstract.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Quad</b>
          <br></br>A quadruple jump, that is to say a jump with four rotations
          off the ice. Most ladies can't land any quads (although there are more
          and more exceptions!) while men can't really be competitive
          internationally if they can't land at least one. Quad lutzes, quad
          loops, quad toeloops, quad salchows and quad flips have all been
          landed in competition. The only quad no one knows how to do yet is the
          elusive quad axel...
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Skating skills</b>
          <br></br>Skating skills is a broad term which basically defines the
          way a skater behaves on the ice : their edges, their speed, their
          glide, their turns, their steps, their ice coverage... Everything that
          makes skating look beautiful and effortless. Skating skills have
          little to do with technical elements such as jumps. The best skating
          skills are found in ice dance, but some singles skaters have gorgeous
          skating skills as well.
        </p>

          <b>Uncle</b>
          <br></br>A term used by some figure skating fans to characterize a
          slightly older male skater. You start entering uncle territory when
          you're around 28 years old. This is meant as an endearing term, not a
          derogatory one. I love uncles! It's nice to have adults in the sport
          who are still competitive and have long careers. Uncles also tend to
          have less traditional music choices and have more fun on the ice.
          Unfortunately, ladies tend to retire before their late twenties, so
          there is no female equivalent.
        </p>

          <b>Warhorse</b>
          <br></br>A warhorse is a piece of music that has been skated too A LOT
          during figure skating history. The term is liberally used now
          (Despacito has become kind of a warhorse during the Olympic season)
          but, traditionally, it refers to a story that's been told a lot, not
          just the music. For instance, Romeo and Juliet is a warhorse, whether
          you use Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev or the soundtrack from the 1996 movie.
          Carmen is a warhorse. Swan Lake is a warhorse. Moulin Rouge. Phantom
          of the Opera. You get the point. Warhorses are easily identified by
          judges, therefore you're not really taking any risks with your
          program, but it also makes it harder to stand out when you're the
          fifth Carmen during a competition. It is, however, possible to take
          risks with a warhorse and make it really unique (see Daisuke
          Takahashi's 'Cyberswan' program). Nowadays you can also see modern
          warhorses emerge, such as Muse's Exogenesis Symphony.

        <h1>But Camille, what's the Grand Prix?</h1>
        <p>
          The Grand Prix of Figure Skating is a fairly recent competition (it
          was created in 1995) but it's a super important one: only the best
          skaters in the world get to compete there. Winning the Grand Prix
          series isn't as good as being a World champion, but it's still a very
          big deal.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="about-how" className="about-div">
        <h1>How does the competition work?</h1>
        <p>
          The events take place in the usual figure skating categories: ladies
          singles, men singles, pairs and ice dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In each category, the skaters that meet the requirements are assigned
          one or two competitions among the following:
        </p>
        <ul className="my-list">
          <li>Skate America (USA)</li>
          <li>Skate Canada (Canada)</li>
          <li>Internationaux de France (France)</li>
          <li>Cup of China (China)</li>
          <li>Rostelecom Cup (Russia)</li>
          <li>NHK Trophy (Japan)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Prominent international skaters usually get two assignments, while
          up-and-coming skaters are more likely to only get one.
          <br></br>
          The organizing federation of each event also gets 'host spots', that
          they can give to skaters they like, usually local skaters, and who
          wouldn't have been able to qualify for a GP otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The placement of the skater at each competition will grant them a
          certain number of points. After the competitions are over, the skaters
          with the most points get to compete at the <b>Grand Prix Final</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Grand Prix Final will take place in Turin, Italy in December 2019.
          Whoever wins there will be the Grand Prix champion for their category,
          which, again, is a pretty huge deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The participants were assigned to their respective Grand Prix
          competitions on June 20th, so now we know who we are going to see
          skate in Grenoble and we can finally HOP ON THE HYPE TRAIN.
